[x] Function that put each line of envp in a chained list.
[x] Function that search a key (ex : PATH) in the envp chained list and return associated value.
[x] Function that add a node in the envp chained list, usefull to make export builtin. (list_add_back + create node ?)
[x] Function that delete a node in the envp chained list, usefull for unset builtin.
[x] Function that display the envp chained list, usefull for env builtin.
[x] Fix "envp_list_add" so it del before adding if the key already axist.
[x] Make the export (builtin) logic.
[x] Make the unset (builtin) logic.
[x] Make de env (builtin) logic.
[x] Make cd (builtin) logic
[x] Make history.
[x] Function that test if a command is valid (get PATH value -> split -> concat path + cmd -> use access return true/false).
[x] Function that make a char ** from envp link list.
[ ] make echo as a builtin (-n argument).
[ ] Make heredoc input implementation.
[ ] Pipe : 
	[x] Put every function in correct folder.
	[x] Clean .h pipe_utils section.
	[ ] Secure functions.
	[ ] Handle Error.
	[ ] Check if command is a builtin if yes do nothing.
	[ ] implement redirection.
	Idea :
	Group everything within pipe symbol, check if the string contain builtin then check if redirection then make char **commands out of whats left.
	If builtins do nothing, if redirection do it before exec command.
	"ls -l ./history | grep ".txt" | wc -l >> output.txt" => ["ls -l ./history", "grep ".txt"", " wc -l >> output.txt""] => 
[ ] Redirection :
	[x] redirect_input need to check if source is fd or file.
	[x] make redirect_output function (non parsing compatible yet).
	[ ] test input/output redirect_input.
	[ ] securise.
[ ] Signals : 
	[ ] ctrl + \ should do nothing exept for 'grep ""' where it should behave normaly (core dumped).
	[ ] ctrl + c should just display '^c', in the heredoc and 'grep ""' it should quit.
	[ ] ctrl + d should exit, in the heredoc it should auit and display 'bash: warning: here-document at line 2 delimited by end-of-file (wanted `d')', in 'grep ""' it should quit.
[ ] Bug :
	[x] Clear not working anymore since changing envp for local envp (err msg : TERM environment variable not set.) maybe fill_envp_list() malfunction ??
	[x] Readline leaks. (valg --suppressions=ignore_leaks.supp)
[ ] Question : 
	[ ] How to error handle launch_pipe ?
